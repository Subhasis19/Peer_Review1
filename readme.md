# HTML Resume Project

## What I Did

I created a professional HTML resume webpage for Subhasis Samantasinghar. The resume includes all essential sections: personal information, about me, skills, work experience, projects, education, and contact details. The page is structured using semantic HTML tags and follows proper HTML5 standards.

### List Tags

- `<ul>` - Unordered list container (for Skills and Project details)
